## What are we brewing thoughts?

_Brewing thoughts_ refers to ideas, refections or insights that are forming and evolving in my mind - like coffee brewing, where the process takes time. These could be half-formed ideas, intial sketches or thoughts that are still in the process of being refined.

I will be sharing these thoughts here, as they are brewing. They may not be fully developed or coherent, and they only refect the state of my mind at the time of writing. 

I hope that by sharing these thoughts, they help me to think through them, and I hope they can be helpful to others as well.
