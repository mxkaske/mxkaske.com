Today, we experiment with the newly released [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions) and the `experimental_useFormStatus` hook.

Because our `Form` is a Client Component, we'll need to move the action into a separate `actions.ts` file with the "use server" directive. This is totally fine and I might use it even in Server Components to keep make it easier to switch a file from RSC to RCC and to separate the concerns.

> For testing purposes, we set a `timeout` of 2000ms to display a loading state and simulate a database connection.

```ts
// actions.ts
"use server";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export async function submitEmail(data: FormData) {
  const email = data.get("email");
  if (email) {
    // connect to database and store email
    redirect(`/?form=success&email=${email}`);
  }
  return;
}
```

Let's have a closer look to the form component. You will quickly notice that we are using a Client Component with the main purpose of detecting and mutating the incoming `searchParams`.
All the non-rendering part is optional but makes the form feel interactive.

You might have noticed that we redirect the form action to `/?form=success&email=${email}` which allows us to create a toast to notify the user on the form status, which in our case always _succeeded_. Once done, we are reseting the search parameters. In case the user accidentally refreshes the page, we won't show him again the toast notification.

```tsx
// form.tsx
"use client";

import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";
import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast";
import { usePathname, useRouter, useSearchParams } from "next/navigation";
import { submitEmail } from "./actions";
import { SubmitButton } from "./submit-button";
import { useCallback, useEffect } from "react";

export function Form() {
  const { toast } = useToast();
  const searchParams = useSearchParams();
  const pathname = usePathname();
  const router = useRouter();

  const resetSearchParams = useCallback(() => {
    const params = new URLSearchParams(searchParams.toString());
    console.log({ params });
    params.delete("email");
    params.delete("form");
    router.replace(`${pathname}?${params.toString()}`);
  }, [searchParams, router, pathname]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const form = searchParams.has("form") && searchParams.get("form");
    const email = searchParams.has("email") && searchParams.get("email");

    if (form === "success" && email) {
      toast({
        title: "Joined Waitlist",
        description: `Added ${email} to the fake waitlist.`,
      });
      resetSearchParams();
    }
  }, [toast, searchParams, resetSearchParams]);

  return (
    <form
      action={submitEmail}
      className="not-prose grid w-full max-w-sm gap-1.5"
    >
      <div className="grid w-full gap-1.5">
        <div className="flex w-full items-end gap-1.5">
          <div className="grid w-full gap-1.5">
            <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
            <Input
              required
              name="email"
              id="email"
              type="email"
              placeholder="me@domain.com"
            />
          </div>
          <SubmitButton />
        </div>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground text-xs">
          Enter any fake email schema.
        </p>
      </div>
    </form>
  );
}
```

Now you might wonder why we need a separate `SubmitButton`. This is because the current [`useFormStatus`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions#experimental-useformstatus) seems to not work in the same file as the `Form`. As simple as that. And I couldn't figure out the specific reason, as both components are Client Components.

```tsx
// submit-button.tsx
"use client";

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { experimental_useFormStatus as useFormStatus } from "react-dom";
import { LoadingAnimation } from "./loading-animation";

export function SubmitButton() {
  const { pending } = useFormStatus();
  return (
    <Button
      type="submit"
      disabled={pending}
      className="w-20 disabled:opacity-100"
    >
      {pending ? <LoadingAnimation /> : "Join"}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

The loading animation is inspired by the vercel's one. It's build with [`tailwind-animate`](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/tailwindcss-animate) which is added to [ui.shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) by default. Otherwise we could easily extend the [`tailwind.config.js`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#adding-utilities) with utilities. [Let me know](https://twitter.com/mxkaske) if you have any questions. I won't go deeper into it!
